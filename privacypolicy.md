This is an open source Android app. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

To the best of my knowledge and belief, that this app does not collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

This app requests a number of permissions, including a wide-reaching Accessiblity Service permission. These are necessary for the app's function (the overlay) to work reliably with minimal battery impact, and no data is collected using this service.
